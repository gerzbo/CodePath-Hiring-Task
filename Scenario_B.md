## Response to Jane's Application

Hi Jane,

Thank you for your enthusiastic response and for dedicating your time and effort to complete the application process, including building the Flix app. We appreciate your commitment and understand your disappointment regarding the eligibility requirements.

First and foremost, we want to express our sincere admiration for your dedication to learning and your interest in our program. We understand that sometimes the eligibility criteria can be confusing, and we apologize for any lack of clarity in our application process. We truly value applicants like you who are eager to join our courses.

We completely understand your situation and your frequent visits to the US. Your passion for learning is commendable, and we would love to have you as part of our program. However, there are certain limitations imposed by our current sponsorships and non-profit organization status that restrict our courses to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. 

While we cannot make exceptions to these eligibility requirements at this time, we want you to know that your efforts and dedication have not gone unnoticed. We are genuinely impressed by your commitment to learning and your willingness to invest time in our application process. Your application will serve as a testament to your dedication, and we encourage you to explore other learning opportunities, including online resources and courses that might align with your goals and interests.

We also appreciate your feedback about the clarity of our application process. We continuously strive to improve our communication and make the requirements more transparent for all applicants.

If you have any further questions or if there's any way we can assist you in your learning journey in the future, please do not hesitate to reach out. We wish you the best in your endeavors and hope you find the right opportunities to further your skills and knowledge.

Thank you again for your interest in CodePath, and we hope you continue to pursue your passion for learning.


All the best,

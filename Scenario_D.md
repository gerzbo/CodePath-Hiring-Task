## Response to Dennis's Request for Another Chance

Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out and expressing your willingness to address the situation regarding your removal from the AND101 (Intro to Android Development) course. We appreciate your dedication to the course material and your desire to continue your learning journey.

As you know, complete and on-time assignment submission is core to our educational model! We only allow 1 late assignment per semester and even one missed assignment will result in removal from the course as outlined in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19).

Would you like to use this assignment for your 1 allowed late assignment? If so, **you need to submit your assignment with all required stories completed within 24 hours after this notice.** Please let us know as soon as possible what your plan is with this assignment and the course moving forward.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team

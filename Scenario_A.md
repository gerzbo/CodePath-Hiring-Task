## Response to John's Request

Hi John,

Thank you for your enthusiasm and interest in our Web Development program. We appreciate your application and your desire to excel in your studies. However, I wanted to clarify our placement process and why we are unable to transfer you to the Advanced track based solely on your pre-work score or academic background.

Our admission process is designed to ensure that students are placed in a track that aligns with their technical interview skills and proficiency level. We aim to provide the best learning experience for all our students by placing them in a track that suits their current abilities, allowing them to thrive and progress at a comfortable pace.

While your academic achievements, such as being a straight-A sophomore at MIT, are certainly commendable, our Web Development program primarily evaluates applicants based on their technical skills and aptitude during the interview process. The decision to place you in the Intermediate track was made after careful consideration of your pre-work score and performance in the technical interview.

To give you a better understanding of the course content and pacing, I have provided the overview links for both the Intermediate and Advanced tracks below:

- [Intermediate Track Overview](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/web102/syllabus)
- [Advanced Track Overview](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/web103/syllabus)

As you can see, there may be some overlap in the initial topics of both tracks, but the pacing and depth of the material diverge significantly as the courses progress. Our aim is to ensure that students have a comfortable learning experience without feeling overwhelmed or unchallenged.

We believe that starting in the Intermediate track will allow you to build a strong foundation and gradually progress to more advanced topics. Rest assured that our instructors are highly skilled and dedicated to helping students succeed in their chosen track.

If you have any concerns or questions about the program, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to support your learning journey and want to ensure that you have a rewarding experience in our Web Development program.

Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to having you as part of our program.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
